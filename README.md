# PPP_Analysis_and-Data-Warehouse

 &emsp; This project cannot be fully shown in Git Hub as it requires access to Google Big Query. What can be shown is the analysis that was done on the data and the cleaning and processing part.
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a federal loan program designed to assist businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 &emsp; Conducting a data analysis project on PPP loans can provide valuable insights for both the government and small businesses.
For the government, a thorough analysis can help identify areas for improvement in the program and ensure that funds are being distributed effectively.
For small businesses, a data analysis project can help them understand how PPP loans are being used by other companies in their industry, and provide them with information that can help them make more informed decisions about how to use the funds they receive.
